# Rouge Rogue
The first project made for the Semester 2, 2022, CS 162 Class 

In Rouge Rogue you play as a Rogue exploring randomly generated dungeons fighting Trolls and Orcs along the way. It would be best if you kept some potions on yourself during the exploration.

HOW TO PLAY:

Arrow Keys: Move around the dungeons and to fight monsters by ramming into them!
G: Used to pick up items on the floor!
I: Opens up your inventory!
    - To navigate the items in the inventory press keys A-Z as they appear on the list to use the items!
V: Opens up the event log letting you peek into the history of your adventure!
/: Allows you to look around the map and look at what is around your FOV!
D: Opens up your inventory to drop items you no longer want!
C: Lets you look at the player details!
    - Also provides you insight on how far away you are from Leveling up!
ESC: Alternative way to exit the game!
PERIOD, KEYPAD 5, and CLEAR: Wait keys for when you don't want to move on your turn!
