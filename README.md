# Omega's Labyrinth by Omega-Who/omega#6252
The first project made for my CS 162 Class!

**HOW TO INSTALL:**

Installation is simple, first you need to install the latest version of Python at the time of writing this being 3.10.2<br>
After you install Python open a Command Prompt window and redirect commands to this folder. <br>
Once that is done type 'pip install -r requirements.txt' to download the needed packages.<br>
To launch the game you will need to open up a Powershell, Python Shell, or Command Promt then change to the games directory; then type in 'python main.py' to finally play the game!
