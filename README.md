# Omega's Labyrinth
The first project made for my CS 162 Class!<br>
I plan to continue adding to this until around early-mid March or until I decide I'm done with this project and move onto a new one!<br>
I would also like to mention I would not have been able to make this without the help of a [Tutorial](https://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/v2/)


**HOW TO INSTALL:**

After you install the Game.zip file, to play the game click on Game.exe and it will launch the game!<br>

If you don't have Python and want to edit the game or look at the code then follow what is mentioned below!<br>

Installation is simple, first you need to install the latest version of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) at the time of writing this being 3.10.2<br>
After you install Python open a Command Prompt window and redirect commands to this folder. <br>
Once that is done type 'pip install -r requirements.txt' to download the needed packages.<br>
To launch the game you will need to open up a Powershell, Python Shell, or Command Promt then change to the games directory; then type in 'python main.py' or '/main.py' to finally play the game!<br>
